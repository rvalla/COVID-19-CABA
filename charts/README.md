# COVID-19 data (Buenos Aires City)

Here are the output charts from *processed datasets* I found interesting. You can make your own.

- **n_**: the number at the beginning of the file tells you what language was used for titles and axis.
- **filename**: the name of the file should tell you about the chart content.
