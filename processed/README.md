# COVID-19 data (Buenos Aires City)

The *.csv* files in */processed* are the result of making some changes in original datasets. Among all,
little changes in date format, sorting and addition of useful ratios and averages.

- **emergencycalls.csv**: shows the number of calls about *COVID-19* by day, taking 7 day average and the
ratio between different categories and total calls.
